# Spring Boot REST API Project

This repository contains a **Spring Boot REST API application** that I built as part of my **learning and practice journey**.  
The project is **not fully developed by me from scratch** — it is a **collaborative, tutorial-based, and forked-learning project** where I studied open-source implementations, followed guides, and made my own improvements to understand how real REST APIs are designed.

## 📘 Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to **learn how to build and work with RESTful APIs using Spring Boot**.  
By working on this codebase, I gained practical knowledge of:

- Designing REST endpoints  
- Handling HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)  
- Using Controllers, Services & Repository layers  
- Working with JPA/Hibernate  
- JSON request–response handling  
- Exception handling in REST APIs  
- Database integration with MySQL  
- API testing using Postman  

Although this project is based on **tutorials and a forked repository**, I have made **custom changes and improvements** as part of my learning.

## 🚀 Features of the REST API

- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations  
- Layered architecture  
- DTOs (if applicable)  
- Global exception handling  
- Validation on request bodies  
- MySQL database integration  
- Clean JSON responses  
- Tested using Postman

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Web**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Hibernate**
- **MySQL**
- **Maven**
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## 🌱 Learning-Based Contribution

This project is created as part of my **backend development learning**.  
I want to clearly mention:

- I **forked the original GitHub project** for learning.  
- I followed **online tutorials, documentation, and guides**.  
- I implemented **my own modifications**, such as:
  - Refactoring code  
  - Renaming classes  
  - Adding validations  
  - Changing REST endpoints  
  - Adding comments  
  - Adjusting database configurations  
  - Fixing minor bugs  

This project helped me understand **real development workflows**, even though it is not an entirely original project.
