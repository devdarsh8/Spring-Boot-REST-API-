# Business Management Web Application

This is a **collaborative, learning-based project** that I built while exploring **Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL**.  
The project is **not created fully from scratch** by me — instead, I followed tutorials, studied open-source implementations, and **forked an existing GitHub project**, then modified and customized it to improve my understanding of backend development.

This project helped me learn:
- How real-world Spring Boot applications are structured  
- How to build CRUD operations using services & repositories  
- Authentication and role-based access  
- Working with Thymeleaf templates  
- Integrating MySQL with Spring Boot  
- Improving code readability and project structure  

I have made several changes, improvements, and configurations on top of the forked code as part of my hands-on practice.
